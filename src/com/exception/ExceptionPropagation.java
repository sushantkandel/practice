/**In this program we are focusing on the exception propagation.
 * As we have the exception propagation class where it contains various method which is calling the next method explicitly
 * Here we are calling the College method from the static main class and college method is calling the student method of Exception propagation
 * and Student method is calling the student  marks method
 * In the student mark method the index of the student id is assign to 40 but we are assigning the  marks to the student having 41 which doesnt exist
 * so it create the ArrayOutOFBoundException which is not handled in the Student marks method so the exception propagate to the previous method student
 * as we are not handling the exception in the student method again it propagate to the college method  willing that may be it is handled in the college method
 * And finally it is handled in the college method.
 * Note:By using exception propagation we can handle the exception in any call stack.
 * Thank you
 * NOTE:Checked exception will not propagate only unchecked Exception propagate.Do you know why?
 * Check exception is compile time exception it gives compile Time error and unchecked exception is run time exception so it is handled in real time.
